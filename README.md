# ML psy, the psychiatric diagnosis assistant

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for ML_psy, a machine learning project aimed at exploring psychiatric diagnosis using data-driven approaches and electroencephalograms (EEG). The goal of the project is to apply machine learning techniques to preprocessed EEG combined to patients informations and diagnosis to learn how to predict the right diagnosis based on a patient resting state EEG.

For more context and details about our methodology and our results, here is a ppt presentation : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aa5zdIPOIvbA-byI0-6vvhN8ntLL60ta1hTDe_XSFfI/edit?usp=sharing

The project was based on a dataset publshed by a psychiatric team, here is the link to the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/eeg-psychiatric-disorders-dataset/data
